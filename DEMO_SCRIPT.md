# Deal Bot — 2-Minute Demo Script

## [0:00–0:10] HOOK

**SAY:**
> "What if you could deploy an entire investment committee — three analysts, an associate, and a partner — in one click, right inside ChatGPT? This is Deal Bot."

---

## [0:10–0:30] STEP 1 — Company Research

**TYPE:**
```
Look up the company mistral.ai
```

**SAY:**
> "I type a domain. The company profile loads instantly — funding raised, team size, revenue estimate, founders, growth stage. All real structured data, no hallucinations."

---

## [0:30–0:50] STEP 2 — Process Deal

**CLICK:** the **"Process Deal →"** button on the widget.

**SAY:**
> "One click launches the full pipeline. Evidence collection starts, competitor profiles are pulled, and three specialized analysts fire simultaneously — market, competition, and traction — each making live tool calls you can watch in real time."

---

## [0:50–1:15] STEP 3 — Watch the Analysts Work

**SAY:**
> "This is the core experience — you're watching your analysts work. The competition analyst is pulling similar companies. The traction analyst is enriching founders. The market analyst is sizing the TAM. The associate starts the moment results arrive — building hypotheses with bull cases, bear cases, and risk mitigants. No one waits."

---

## [1:15–1:35] STEP 4 — Decision Gate + Memo

**SAY:**
> "The partner scores five rubric dimensions — market, moat, timing, execution, deal fit — calibrated to the investor profile. The final output: a decision gate with three testable gating questions and an evidence checklist. Every claim cites real evidence or is flagged as an assumption. The investment memo is auto-generated with an AI-generated cover from fal.ai — download it as PDF."

---

## [1:35–1:50] STEP 5 — How It's Built

**SAY:**
> "Under the hood: the server is deployed on Alpic — one command, straight to production. Alpic hosts the Skybridge MCP server that ChatGPT talks to directly. The three analyst agents run on Dify Cloud using function-calling strategy — each agent has access to Cala, Specter, and Tavily tools via an OpenAPI spec, so they autonomously decide which tools to call and how to chain results. fal.ai generates the cover art for the investment memo. The entire stack — from ChatGPT to agent execution to data retrieval — is live and connected."

---

## [1:50–2:00] CLOSE

**SAY:**
> "One domain. One click. A full investment committee in 60 seconds. This is Deal Bot."
